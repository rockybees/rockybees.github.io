    <h1>Polynomials</h1>

    <p>A $\textbf{polynomial}$ is a specific typle of algebraic expression where the variables have $\textbf{whole number exponents}$
         and appear only in the $\textbf{numerator}$ of each term, such as $2$,$\sqrt{5}x$, $x + y^2$ are polynomials, while $x^{1/2}$, $\frac{1}{x} - 2x$ are non-polynomials.</p>
    <p>A polynomial with one term is called monomial, such as $3$, $2x^3y$, $-5y$.</p>  
    <p>A polynomial with two terms is called binomial, such as $ 2x+3$, $2x^3y - x$, $1-5y$.</p>
    <p>A polynomial with three terms is called trinomial, such as $\sqrt{5}x^2 + 2x + 1$, $y^3 + a - 1$.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The $\textbf{degree}$ of a polynomial $\textbf{term}$ is the sum of the exponents of all its variables.</li>
        <li>The term with the highest degree is called the $\textbf{leading term}$.</li>
        <li>$\textbf{Like terms}$ are either constant terms or terms with the same variables raised to the same exponents.</li>
        <li>The $\textbf{degree}$ of a $\textbf{polynomial}$ is the highest degree among its terms, i.e., the degree of the leading term.</li>

    <!-- <div class="rule-container">
        <p>Note: For exponents of $0$, $0^0$ is undefined or indeterminate because different mathematical contexts suggest different values.</p>
        <p>If we apply the above exponent rule to $0$, it would suggest $0^0 = 1$.</p> 
        <p>However, if we extend the exponent rule $0^n = 0$ (for any $n>0$) to $n = 0$, it would imply $0^0 = 0$, which contradicts the first rule.</p>
    </div> -->
    <h2>Evaluating Polynomials</h2>
    <p>Evaluating a polynomial means to substitute a given numerical value for the variable(s) in the polynomial and 
        computing the resulting value. For example, when evaluating $3x - 1$ at $x = 2$, we substitute $2$ for $x$, and compute $3 \times 2 - 1 = 5$. 
    </p>
    <h2>Multiplying Polynomials</h2>
    <p>
        Multiplying polynomials involves distributing each term of one polynomial to 
        every term of the other polynomial and then combining like terms. The process
        follows the distributive property: $(a + b)(c + d) = a(c+d) + b(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd$.
        <br>For example, $(2x^2 -3x + 1)(x - 5) = 2x^3 - 10x^2 - 3x^2 + 15x + x - 5 = 2x^3 - 13x^2 + 16x - 5$.
    </p>
    <h3>Commonly Used Formulas</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Square of a binomial: $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$, $(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$.</li>
        <li>Cube of a binomial: $(a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$, $(a - b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3$.</li>
        <li>Product of sum and difference: $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2$.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <div id="example-container">
        <h2>Example:</h2>
        <p class="margin-from-left-solution">Rose is using her rubber band of $20cm$ to make a rectangular shape. What is the biggest area she can make?</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <div class="margin-from-left-solution">
            <p>Let the length of the rectangular be $x$. Then, the width is $10 - x$.
            <br>The area $A$ can be expressed as:
            <br>$A = x(10 - x) = -(x^2 -10x) = -(x - 5)^2 + 25$.
            <br>Thus, the maximum area Rose can make with her $20cm$ rubber band is $25cm^2$.
            This occurs when the rectangle is a square, with each side measuring $5cm$.

    <h2>Factoring Polynomials</h2>
    <p>Factoring polynomials is to break down a polynomial into simpler expressions, called factors,
        that multiply together to form the original polynomail. It is the reverse of expanding a product
        of polynomials. Factoring helps in solving polynomial equations, simplifying expressions, and understanding polynomial properties.
    </p>
    <p>Common methods of factoring include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Factoring out the greatest common factor (GCF): Identifying and extracting the GCF from all terms,
            such as: $12x^4 + 8x^3 = 4x^3(3x + 2)$. </li>
        <li>Factoring by grouping: Grouping terms to find common factors, such as $x^3 + x^2 + 5x + 5 = x^2(x + 1) + 5(x + 1) = (x^2 + 5)(x + 1)$.</li>
        <li>Recognizing formulas: For example, difference of squares: $a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)$, 
            <br>perfect square trinomials: $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2$, $a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a - b)^2$,
            <br>sum and difference of cubes: $a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)$, $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note: Factoring polynomials of the type $x^2 + bx + c = (x + m)(x + n)$, find two factors $m$, $n$ of $c$, such that $m + n = b$, 
        such as $x^2 - x - 12 = (x - 4)(x + 3)$.
        <br> Factoring polynomials of the type $ax^2 + bx + c$, it's often not as obvious as the type $x^2 + bx + c$, we can use the following methods:
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Trial and error: for example, it's not hard to find out $2x^2 + 7x - 4 = (2x - 1)(x + 4)$ by trying.
            </li>
            <li>
                Difference of squares: rewrite the quadratic in the form of $(x + p)^2 - q^2$, and then factoring. For example, 
                <br>$2x^2 + 7x - 4 = 2[(x+\frac{7}{4})^2 - \frac{81}{16}] = 2(x+\frac{7}{4}+\frac{9}{4})(x+\frac{7}{4}-\frac{9}{4}) = (x+4)(2x-1)$. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Quadratic formula: use $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. For $2x^2 + 7x - 4$, we get $x = \frac{-7 \pm 9}{4} = -4, 1/2$.
            </li>
            <li>AC method: find two numbers that multiply to ac and add to b. Divide both numbers by a. If any fraction remains, 
                move its denominator to be the coefficient of $x$ in that binomial. For $2x^2 + 7x - 4$, we can find $8$, $-1$, such that $8 \times -1 = 2 \times -4$, $8 - 1 = 7$.
                Divide them by $2$, we have $4$, $-\frac{1}{2}$. Write the factors: $(x + 4)(x - \frac{1}{2})$. Move the denominator $2$ to be the coefficient of $x$, we have $(x + 4)(2x - 1)$ as the factored form.</li>
        </ol>
